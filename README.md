![MozGram Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ErfanBahramali/MozGram-desktop/refs/heads/main/docs/assets/MozGram_banner.jpeg)

**MozGram** is a privacy-focused fork of the official [Telegram Desktop](https://desktop.telegram.org) client, giving users more control over their messages and media.

> Protect yourself against careless "banana eaters" üçå who try to erase your conversations or sneakily delete your files. MozGram gives you **full control** over your chats and privacy on your desktop.

## Who Are the *Moz-Eaters*?

**Moz-Eaters** are ruthless individuals who show no regard for the other side of a conversation. They try to force others into situations that serve only their own interests. **MozGram** is built to protect your side of the story.

---
## Why MozGram?

While Telegram offers end-to-end encryption and secure protocols like MTProto, it allows both sides in a conversation to delete messages for everyone ‚Äî sometimes leading to lost important data or unwanted censorship.

MozGram changes the game by:

- **Disabling two-sided message deletion:** When someone deletes a message for both sides, the message remains visible in your client.
- **Preserving self-destructing media:** Photos, videos, and files sent with self-destruct timers are saved locally as normal files.
- **Respecting your privacy and autonomy:** No more unexpected message vanishing acts by your chat partners.
- **Maintaining full compatibility** with the official Telegram API and MTProto protocol, so your chats stay in sync.
